# Numbers and Bit Manipulation

[!Note]
Important Points to Note and The XOR operator has several applications in computer science, including:
- The XOR (exclusive OR) operation is a fundamental bitwise operation that compares corresponding bits of two operands. The result of the XOR operation is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same.

- Using XOR we can solve problems effitiantly, like.    
  - Find given number is Even or Odd.
  ```C++
  int main()
  {
    int n = 10;
    //Normal method
    if(n % 2 == 0) cout<<"Even Number";

    //Bitwise Method: if last bit of the number is set(1) then number is ODD else EVEN.
    if((n&1) == 0) cout<<"Even Number";
    if(n&1) cout<<"Odd Number";
  }
  ```
  
  - Set Kth Bit.  
    1<<k // left shift by k bits  
    n = n | (1<<k);  

  - Count all set Bits.   
    ```C++
      - //1 aproach -    
      int count = 0;  
      int bit = n % 2;  
      if(bit == 1)  
        count++;  
      n = n/2;  
      return count;  

    - //2nd aproach - using bit operations more efficient.  
      int count = 0;  
      while(n > 0){   
        if(n & 1)   
        count++;  
        n >>= 1; // n = n>>1; right shift bits of number by 1.   
      }   
      return count; 
    ```

- Toggling bits: XORing a bit with 1 flips its value, while XORing with 0 leaves it unchanged.  
e.g. Used in Encrypetion Algorithms (if we do XOR two times it will give the same original number only).  
e.g.- Set 3rd position bit  
  unsigned int num = 10; // Binary: 1010    
  int position = 3; // Position of the bit to toggle    
  // Toggle the bit at the specified position   
  num ^= (1 << position); //num = 1010^0100= 1110   
  num ^= (1 << position); //num = 1110^0100= 1010 - original, like encryption.

- Finding the difference between two values: XORing two values results in a value where the set bits indicate the positions where the original values differ.
- If there are an even number of 1s (e.g., 0, 2, 4...), the XOR operation will result in 0. This is because for every 1, there must be another 1 paired with it to produce a 0 output (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0).

- If there are an odd number of 1s (e.g., 1, 3, 5...), the XOR operation will result in 1. This is because there will always be one unpaired 1 left, resulting in a 1 output (e.g., 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1).

- Cryptography: XOR is used in some encryption algorithms due to its reversibility.

- Error detection: XOR can be used to calculate checksums for data transmission.

- Swapping variables: XOR can swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

  int x = 10;
  int y = 5;    
  x = x ^ y;    
  y = x ^ y;    
  x = x ^ y;    
  // Output: x = 5, y = 10


# Basic coding questions

### 1. find given number is prime or not: number is prime only if it is divisible by 1 or itself only, should not be devisible with the 2 to n-1.
```C++
bool checkPrime(int n)
{
  for(int i = 2; i < n; i++)
    if(n%i == 0)
      return false;

  //optimised solution - it is mathematically proven that if any number has factors other than 1 or N, then it is present in sqrt of N.
  #include<cmath> //for sqrt()
    for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
      if(n%i == 0)
        return false;
}
```
### 2. Reverse the number. 
```C++
/*
- In C++, INT_MAX and INT_MIN are macros that represent the maximum and minimum values that an int variable can hold. 
- The range of int (signed int) is in between INT_MIN and INT_MAX because of int is 32 bit number, int variable can't store the number less then INT_MIN (-2,147,483,648) and more than INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). 
- If we try to store then number will go above 32 bit and results in undefined behavior due to integer overflow.
*/
#include <climits> //for INT_MIN and INT_MAX
#include <limits.h>
  int reverse(int n)
  { 
    if(n < INT_MIN){
      return 0;
    }

    if(n < 0){
      isNeg = true;
      n = -n;
    }

    int reverseNumber = 0;
    while(n){
      if(reverseNumber > INT_MAX/10){
        // - while reversing if number goes above INT_MAX then it will behave unexpected, because int variable can't store it.
        return 0;
      }
      reverseNumber = reverseNumber * 10 + (n % 10);
      n /= 10;
    }
  }
```

# Hashing   

#### Hashing in data structures is a technique used to map keys to their corresponding values in a table (often called a hash table) using a hash function. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data by quickly calculating the index where a key-value pair should be stored or found.

## How it works:
### 1. Hash Function:   
A hash function takes a key (which can be of any size) and converts it into a fixed-size value, typically an integer, called a hash code or hash value. 

### 2. Hash Table:
The hash table is an array-based data structure where each element is stored at an index determined by the hash code of its corresponding key. 

### 3. Collision Handling:
When two different keys produce the same hash code (a collision), methods like chaining or open addressing are used to resolve the conflict and store both key-value pairs. 

## Key Concepts:
#### Key: The unique identifier used to locate a value. 
#### Value: The data associated with a specific key. 
#### Hash Function: The function that converts a key into a hash code. 
#### Hash Code: The integer value derived from a key using the hash function. 
#### Hash Table: The array-based data structure that stores key-value pairs. 
#### Collision: When two different keys produce the same hash code. 

## Why use hashing?
### Efficiency:
Hashing provides fast average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and searching operations, making it suitable for large datasets. 

### Fast Data Retrieval:
By using a hash function, data can be accessed directly based on its key, significantly reducing search time compared to linear searching or other methods. 

### Space Optimization:
Hashing can help minimize space usage by storing data in a compact manner within the hash table. 

## Types of Hashing:
### Chaining:
Collisions are resolved by storing multiple key-value pairs that hash to the same index in a linked list or other data structure. 

### Open Addressing:
Collisions are resolved by probing for an available slot in the hash table. Examples include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing. 

### Universal Hashing:
A technique that randomly selects a hash function from a family of hash functions to improve collision resistance. 

## Examples:
### Dictionaries:
Hashing is commonly used to implement dictionaries or associative arrays, where you can quickly look up a value based on a key. 

### Databases:
Hashing can be used to create indexes for faster data retrieval in databases. 

### Password Storage:
Hashing is used to store passwords securely, where the password is not stored directly but rather its hash value. 
Hashing is a fundamental concept in data structures and has numerous applications in computer science due to its efficiency and speed in storing and retrieving data.
